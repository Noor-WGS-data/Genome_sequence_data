# 1. Download Genome Sequence Data Using `sFTP`
###### tags: `2. Main Steps` `tutorials` `sftp` `genome sequence data`

## Setups
1. Check that you have all the correspondence you need: host, username, and password. 
2. Make sure you have access to Duke Compute Cluster (DCC). This instruction assumes that you will use `sftp` (stands for 'secure file transfer protocol') to transfer the genome sequence file *directly onto the cluster*, bypassing your local computer. This means the genome sequence data will *not*, in any given time, be stored in your local computer.
3. What is cluster? What is ssh? Follow the link here. 


## Instructions
1. Log into your cluster using ssh 
2. Type in `sftp user.name@sftp.genewiz.com`
    * `sftp` stands for "secure file transfer protocol"
    * Do *not* use `user.name` literally, use the actual username given by Genewiz
    * This command lets you access the file storage of Genewiz specifically allocated for your username
3. Type `yes` to the prompted command about the key fingerprints. (Essentially, fingerprint is your computer/user's identity, which the system has yet to recognize if this is your first time logging in.)
4. Enter the password provided by Genewiz 
    * Don't worry if you type in and nothing shows up. Normally, typing in passcode on terminal does not show '********' like normal browser everyday does. You ARE typing something, just that nothing changes on the screen.
    * **Pro tip:** Sarah found out that you can copy and paste the password
6. Set up the local directory where you want to download these files into
```
    lcd /datacommons/noor2/lethal_seq/2021_09_21_fastq
```
7. Navigate through sftp folders until you reach the directory that contains all fastq files
    * Use `ls` to list all file and directories within your working directory
    * Use `pwd` to prints the path to the current working directory
    * Remember to use `cd folder_name` to navigate to the lower level directory
    * To get out of your current directory up one level--go to the 'parental directory,' you can use `cd ..` command.
    * If you don't remember all these commands. Go here. 
9. There are two ways to download the files:
    * Download all files within the project folder using `mget *` 
    * Download the folder AND everything within that folder by using **recursive** command `get -r Parent_folder`

## Tips
If you are working on DCC's shared space, and need a writing permission to download the files. You, or the owner of the directory, need to change the permission of the directory to "writable" for everyone. 

    chmod -R 777 Folder_name

This command line will fully open access to all (user/group/others).
